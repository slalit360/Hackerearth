Alex and his String

Alex has a string S of length N consisting of lowercase alphabets. He wants to find lexicographically smallest string X of length N that can be formed using the following operation.

In one operation, he can select any one character among the at most first K characters of string S, remove it from string S and append it to string X. He can apply this operation as many times as he wants.

Help Alex find the string X.

Input format :

The first line consists of a string of length N
The second line consists of an integer K.

Output format :

Print the lexicographically minimum string that can be formed using the above operation.

Sample Input :

>>hackerearth
>>3

Sample Output :

>>aceheakrhrt

Explanation:

First you can select 'a' from "hackerearth". Now the string X becomes "a" and string S becomes "hckerearth".
Now after applying the operation again, the string X becomes "ac" and the string S becomes "hkerearth".
Similarly after applying the operation n times, the string X becomes "aceheakrhrt".
